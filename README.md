# Mini Hackathon - Simon Says Game

This project was created for a mini hackathon with the challenge of building something in three hours using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Concept:**

This is a recreation of the classic memory game "Simon Says" with a focus on simplicity and clean code. 

**Gameplay:**

* A grid of colored buttons is presented to the player.
* The game randomly generates a sequence of button presses.
* The sequence is displayed visually and with an optional audio cue.
* The player must then correctly repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
* Each round successfully completed increases the sequence length, making it progressively harder.
* Clicking the wrong button results in game over.

**Goal:**

The goal is to reach the highest possible sequence length before making a mistake.

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
